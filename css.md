#How I .css

Atomic Design is a great methodology but I get caught up on the naming conventions. 

Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages are difficult to get a team to normalize on. Pages and Templates sound very similar and will confuse folks looking with a CMS-lens.

* **elements** - The native body elements (ul,p,div,etc.)
* **components** -
