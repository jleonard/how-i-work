#How I .css

### .less
> [.less](http://lesscss.org/) is my preprocessor of choice. [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is cool but I prefer node/npm tools. They're very similar so there's really no wrong answer.

### a tweak on [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
Atomic Design is a great methodology but I get caught up on the naming conventions. Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages are difficult to get a team to normalize on. Pages and Templates sound very similar and will confuse anyone approaching the project with a CMS-lens. Pages and Templates also break the bio-chem naming convention. Anyway, I obsess on naming and it's something I need to work on.
